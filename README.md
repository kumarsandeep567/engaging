# engaging
A real time messaging platform built using React, Inertia.js, Laravel, Laravel Reverb, TailwindCSS, and MySQL

What works:
1) User authentication (Sign up & Sign in)
2) Conversation list (Personal chats and group chats)
3) Sending messages to other users
4) Blocking a user
5) Markdown support for messages
6) Infinite scrolling to load older messages
7) Update conversation list when new messages are received
8) Added emoji support

What's broken?
1) Persistent Dark theme

TODO:
1) Style markdowns appropriately in the chats
2) Message notifications
3) Support file upload for attachments
4) Support profile photos for users and groups
5) Allow users to delete their messages
6) Implement group chat operations (Add new members, etc)

Deployment (AWS):
