## **Installation**  

***Prerequisite:** Please install [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) on your operating system*

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository (and navigate to it):**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kumarsandeep567/engaging.git
   cd engaging
   ```

2. **Setup a MySQL database on AWS Relational Database Service**
- Provide the database host URL, database name, username, and password in the `.env.example` file
- Proceed to the next step once the database is ready

3. **Start the application with Docker Compose:**
    ```bash
   docker compose up
   ```

   *(If the above command does not work, try this)*

   ```bash
   docker-compose up
   ```

4. **View the application:**
- Visit `localhost` in the browser to view the application!
- To sign in to the application, use 
    - Email: `ryan@example.com` or `emma@example.com`
    - Password: `password`


## **Troubleshooting**  

- The `docker-compose.yml` file will try loading the database with some dummy data. Please be patient until the process is complete.
- If the script fails, you will have to manually load the database. To do this, 
    - Install PHP ([XAMPP](https://www.apachefriends.org/download.html) recommended for easy-to-use)
    - Start the Apache server
    - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal with ```cd engaging```
    - Run `php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force`
    - In the `docker-compose.yml`, comment out the line `RUN php artisan migrate:fresh --seed --force`
    - Start the containers with Docker Compose
