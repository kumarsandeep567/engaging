A real time messaging platform built using React, Laravel, Inertia.js, TailwindCSS, and MySQL

What works:
1) User authentication (Sign up & Sign in)
2) Conversation list (Personal chats and group chats)
3) Sending messages to other users
4) Blocking a user
5) Markdown support for messages

What's broken?
1) Persistent Dark theme

TODO:
1) Update conversation list when new messages are received
2) Message notifications
3) Load older messages on load
4) Support file upload for attachments
5) Support profile photos for users and groups
